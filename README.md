Also displayed are the top 15 news stories in the US in current time. Users are able to sort search results by relevance (default) or by publish dats (starting by new). A useContext react hook is also used to toggle a dark/light theme for a better viewing experience. The repo uses multiple compoenents including the header, footer, and sidebar. The footer contains a contact link to send an email to the developer.
